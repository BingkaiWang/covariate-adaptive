This repo stores the code for the paper "Model-Robust Inference for Clinical Trials that Improve Precision by Stratified Randomization and Adjustment for Additional Baseline Variables", which can be accessed [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13954).

The R folder cotains three functions, which are used for estimation and inference under different settings. The "ICAD" function is for binary or continuous outcomes. The "ICAD_tte" function is to estimate restricted mean survival time for time-to-event outcomes. The "ICAD-km" function is to calculate the Kaplan-Meier estimator in survival analysis.
